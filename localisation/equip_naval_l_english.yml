 submarine_3:0 "Submarine III"
 submarine_4:0 "Submarine IV"
 submarine_1_desc:0 "Submarines are stealthy vessels designed to take out undefended convoys. The early models from the Great War pave the way for new methods of naval warfare."
 submarine_2_desc:0 "Better armed and more stable, new submarine designs are made to take advantage of advancements in naval tactics and have longer range, being able to attack distant convoy routes."
 submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 submarine_4_desc:0 "Increased test depth and efficient layouts will be features of the modern submarines, taking advantage of field experience to select appropriate armaments and engines."
 destroyer_1:0 "Gunboat I"
 destroyer_2:0 "Gunboat II"
 destroyer_3:0 "Gunboat III"
 destroyer_4:0 "Gunboat IV"
 destroyer_1_desc:0 "To ensure the safety of convoys, the destroyers of the Great War must be repurposed and developed. Arming vessels with more torpedoes will allow more opportunities to engage."
 destroyer_2_desc:0 "Longer torpedo range and faster reload speeds, along with new types of armaments such as anti-air turrets, will allow our destroyers to remain efficient and versatile."
 destroyer_3_desc:0 "To better face threats from above and below, new destroyers must be outfitted with radar and modern anti-air and anti-submarine weaponry."
 destroyer_4_desc:0 "The modern destroyer must be fitted with a variety of different detection technologies, new depth charge deployment systems and be built at a larger scale than their predecessors."
 TUR_destroyer_1:0 "Samsun Class"
 TUR_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers were built in France under Ottoman order, but by the time the Ottoman Empire joined the war they were considered outdated because of bad machinery maintenance, eventually they were repaired in 1925 but never saw any action after the war."
 TUR_destroyer_2:0 "Taşköprü Class"
 TUR_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Eight of these gunboats were ordered by the Ottoman Empire and laid down in France in 1907, and commissioned by the Ottoman navy in 1908. Five were sunk by the Italians in the Italo-Turkish war, the others were sunk by Russian mines and destroyers."
 TUR_destroyer_3:0 "Aydin Reis Class"
 TUR_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Four of these gunboats were laid down in France for the Ottoman navy, one was stricken by a russian mine in the Bosporus, but salvaged and repaired. Two were later presented by Atatürk's government to the Soviet Union but they were returned two years later."

 light_cruiser_2:0 "Cruiser II"
 light_cruiser_3:0 "Cruiser III"
 light_cruiser_4:0 "Cruiser IV"
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Maneuverable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Post-war treaties put restrictions on cruisers, but well-armed light vessels can be developed while remaining within these limits."
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Now skirting the limits of treaties, larger and more heavily armored cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
 light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Tactically employed to protect larger ships, the modern generation of light cruisers can shake off most past restrictions and be better armed to handle aerial attacks."
 TUR_light_cruiser_3:0 "Midilli Class"
 TUR_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Midilli was actually the ex-German 'Breslau' which had been 'sold' to the Ottomans by the Germans in order to escape destruction by the British. She was mined in 1918 and she sank killin 2/3 of her 370 man crew."
 heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Armoured Cruiser I"
 heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Armoured Cruiser II"
 heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Armoured Cruiser III"
 heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Armoured Cruiser IV"
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armor light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armor is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armor can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to cooperate in naval air warfare."
 heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Upscaled, longer and heavier designs with rapid-fire armaments are features in these final stages of heavy cruiser development."
 TUR_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hamidiye Class"
 TUR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hamidiye was ordered in 1901 but it was only laid down in 1902. It was very similar to the Mecidiye but the Ottomans judged it to have been constructed better and her boilers, though older were more reliable."
 TUR_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Drama Class"
 TUR_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "This cruiser was based off an outdated British design, it was laid down in Genoa in 1907 but when the Italo-Turkish war broke out it was requisitioned by Italy and renamed 'Libia'."

 battle_cruiser_2:0 "Battlecruiser II"
 battle_cruiser_3:0 "Battlecruiser III"
 battle_cruiser_4:0 "Battlecruiser IV"
 battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The post-war battlecruiser arms race resulted in several heavily armed designs, sacrificing armor for speed compared to battleships."
 battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Rebuilt and repurposed battlecruisers continue to outrun even modern battleship designs by lighter protection, but have developed better systems for fire control, detection and aerial defenses."
 TUR_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Yavuz Sultan Selim Class"
 TUR_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "This battlecruiser was the ex-German Goeben, which was 'sold' to the Ottomans after having escaped from British and French pursuirs into Constantinople which belonged to the then neutral Ottoman Empire."

 battleship_5:0 "Battleship V"
 battleship_6:0 "Battleship VI"
 battleship_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armored vessels ever built."
 battleship_2_desc:0 "With improved stability and range, a new generation of battleships improve upon previous designs while remaining within limits stipulated by naval treaties."
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armor, stronger engines, a battery of high-caliber guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."
 TUR_battleship_1:0 "Torgud Reis Class"

 TUR_battleship_2_desc:0 "Two ships of this class were laid down in 1911 in Great Britain, but one was cancelled after the outbreak of the First Balkan war, the other one Reşadiye was requisitioned and completed by the British after the outbreak of the war. The Reşadiye served as H.M.S. Erin afterwards."
 TUR_battleship_3:0 "Fatıh Sultan Mehmed Class"
 TUR_battleship_3_desc:0 "This ship was planned to be a slightly bigger version of the Reşadiye, it was ordered in 1914 by the Ottoman Empire, but it was cancelled in the same year by the British after the war broke out. The ship would have been completed in 1917 had the war not intervened."

 carrier_4:0 "Carrier III"
 carrier_5:0 "Carrier IV"
 carrier_6:0 "Carrier V"
 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 carrier_2_desc:0 "As work begins on the first keel-up carrier designs, we must ensure that these ships have the range and speed to keep up with the rest of our navy, while respecting the post-war naval treaties."
 carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
 carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."
