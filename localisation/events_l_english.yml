 news.1.t:0 "The War To End All Wars"
 news.1.d:0 "Welcome to this mod. This game incorporates the time span of First World War and thereby tries to stay preferably close to reality. World War One was shaped by trench warfare and poison gas attacks. Aviation was in it's infancy, battleships celebrate their peak of existence and firstly submarines get used broadly by military. The age of colonism nears it's end and many old-imperialists eye on the German Empire. About June 1914 the Assasination of Sarajevo will pull Central Powers and Entente into the World War. The victors will make history.\n§RTHIS MOD YET IS IN DEVELOPMENT AND MAY CONTAIN ERRORS!$!"
 news.1.a:0 "Let's go!"
 july_crisis.100.t:0 "Assassination in Sarajevo!"
 july_crisis.100.d:0 "Earlier this week, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, visited the Bosnian city of Sarajevo. Today he was murdered by an assassin believed to be associated with the prominent Serbian Nationalist Terrorist group, the Black Hand. Investigations point to Serbian Government not being attributed to the incident, but the assasin acted out of his radical eagerness. How exactly they will go about dealing with this crisis is up to them, but tensions in the region are not expected to cool down any time soon."
 july_crisis.100.a:0 "This can't be good..."
 july_crisis.100.b:0 "How dare they!?"
 july_crisis.110.t:0 "German Support?"
 july_crisis.110.d:0 "After the terrible incident in Sarajevo, our Foreign Minister, Gottlieb von Jagow, suspects that the situation may soon devolve into a war with Serbia. While Serbia, and their ally Montengro are not of any particular threat to the Triple Alliance, he believes that the Pan-Slavic sentiments in the region may cause a greater coalition of enemies to emerge in the south, should there be a war, and it may include Russia. To avoid this hypothetical war with Russia, he suggests we pledge our support to Austria, in hopes of intimidating Serbia out of resisting, which would force Austria-Hungary into war for not loosing their face."
 july_crisis.110.a:0 "Demonstrate our Nibelungentreue!"
 july_crisis.110.b:0 "Let's wait and see what they do."
 july_crisis.111.t:0 "Blank Cheque"
 july_crisis.111.d:0 "We have reports from German Diplomats that they will pledge unconditional support for our further actions in the form of a "Blank Cheque." The timing for this great show of trust is impecable, as we must act fast to save face, we look weak less against a minor nation like Serbia as a Great Power. Our Foreign Minister, Count Leopold von Berchtold, suggests that we use their support for a strong-willed proceed against Serbia. Yet the Council of Ministers is deliberating upon whether to split up Serbia into the Balkan States."
 july_crisis.111.a:0 "(Historical) Demand for what we need at least."
 july_crisis.111.b:0 "Against Germany they will bend."
 july_crisis.111.c:0 "We have to ease off for peace."
 july_crisis.112.t:0 "The German Empire hesitates"
 july_crisis.112.d:0 "After making a diplomatic mission to Berlin, our Foreign Minister, Count Leopold von Berchtold, has returned empty handed, unable to secure absolute support from the Germans. While it would have been nice to have their preemptive support, they and Italy will come to our aid anyways, should the situation in the Balkans turns sour. Not that it'd be necissary. This will invariably work out well for the Austro-Hungarian throne in the end, though, since the perpetual conflicts in the Balkans can be purged now."
 july_crisis.112.a:0 "Without German support, we can't carry out too much."

 july_crisis.112.c:0 "We have to ease off for peace."
 july_crisis.113.t:0 "Austria Sends Ultimatum to Serbia!"
 july_crisis.113.d:0 "While seeking retribution for the assassination of the heir presumptive to the Austrian throne, Austria-Hungary sent an Ultimatum to Serbia demanding certain concessions that would effectively quench Serbia's sovereignty. The Serbian Government may or may not accept those demands, but if they don't, they would need to rely on Russian intervention in the name of the Pan-Slavic sentiments in the region. Austria-Hungary is in need of a proper criminal investigation of the assasination and Serbia won't yield their self-reliance. Both sides are tightened up to their political positions and many fear that unless this issue is dealt with diplomatically, Austria-Hungary and Russia may be launched into all-out war."
 july_crisis.113.a:0 "It's only a formality."
 july_crisis.113.b:0 "Don't do anything stupid."
 july_crisis.114.t:0 "Austia Forgos Retribution."
 july_crisis.114.d:0 "After the assassiantion of the heir presumtive to the Austrian throne, the Kaiser has decided against targeting the Serbian Nation, and instead integrating a détente with the Serbs instead. There is great controversy over whether this was the best course of action, but for now the crisis has been dealt with. Although, in the wake of this decision, many Slavic subjects in the Austro-Hungarian Empire may feel more empowered to seek there own sovereignty, but it is unlikely such sentiments will come to fruition any time soon."
 july_crisis.114.a:0 "I suppose it's for the best."
 july_crisis.114.b:0 "Good."
 july_crisis.121.t:0 "Protect Our Brethren"
 july_crisis.121.d:0 "Austia-Hungary has sent an Ultimatum to the Serbs for performing investigations to the assasination of Franz Joseph under Austrian control and integrating the different population groups into their respectively neighbour states. They don't claim territorital gain themselves, but this incident can be exploited to consolidate our own demands in the Balkans. Our recent loss to Japan several years ago is humiliating, but we have to hold our nobles at bay, else we actually risk a Revolution!"

 july_crisis.121.b:0 "These are not our affairs."
 july_crisis.122.t:0 "Protect Our Brethren"
 july_crisis.122.d:0 "Austia-Hungary has sent an Ultimatum to the Serbs for being allowed to perform investigations to the assasination of Franz Joseph under Austrian observation. We should not take this lying down and interpret it as violating of the Serbian souvereignty to consolidate our own demands in the Balkans. Our recent loss to Japan several years ago is humiliating, but we have to hold our nobles at bay, else we actually risk a Revolution!"

 july_crisis.131.d:0 "Austia-Hungary has sent an Ultimatum to us for performing investigations to the assasination of Franz Joseph under Austrian control. Also we could find out their plans about passing over the non-Serbian part of our population into the Balkan states. International Fold may look at us as a rogue state, but it's the wrong time now for proving converse by choosing the peaceful way, if we don't want to loose in power."

 july_crisis.141.t:0 "The July Crisis"
 july_crisis.141.d:0 "After the recent crisis in the Balkans Serbia gave into Austrian demands and seceded non-Serbian population to the Balkan states. Austria-Hungary has successfully bolstered its power projection in the area and has left the Russians humiliated. While one crisis was averted another is brewing, another grows more tangible. With a strong ally becoming even stronger, many belive that for the good of world balance the Germans had to be curtailed. And with the revanchist French longing to regain Alsace Lorraine; the emerging naval power of Germany eyeing for more colonies; and the humiliated Russians, wishing to dismantle their rivals to the south, the threat of war may seem more imminent than previously thought."

 july_crisis.150.d:0 "The crisis in the Balkans has been rapidly growing out of hand and was hoped to have peaked with Austria-Hungary sending an Ultimatum to the Serbs. But the situation has gotten even worse with the Austrians outright invading Serbia after futile negotiations, and the war will likely turn from a regional conflict to a world-wide catastrophe unless Russia stays neutral. There have been many conflicts in the Balkans before - most recently with the aptly named Balkan War - but never have they turned into a global event. Now it may be different."

 july_crisis.159.d:0 "The fear of a war between all majors powers of Europe has become a harsh reality. Each nation, confident in their own victory, has began mobilizing their armies, if they have not done already. Almost overnight, propoganda posters have appeared, littering the streets of Vienna, Berlin, Paris, and Petrograd, calling on their respective citizens to die for their countries. Or more importantly, make the other soldier die for his."

 flavor_news.1.d:0 "A recent discovery was made by the acclaimed, New Zealand scientist, Ernst Rutherford about the building blocks of the Universe. By conducting an experiment using an alpha particle emitter and thin gold foil. He found that, while most of the alpha particles passed through the gold with ease, a few bounced off on a new trajectory - some even in the direction they came from. This allowed Rutherford to theorize that atoms have a structure, with a large nucleus in the center surrounded by electrons. If his theory is correct, J. J. Thomson's plum pudding model, discovered in 1904, would be incorrect. This finding could absolutely revolutionize humanity's understanding of the world around us and even allow man to harness the true power of the atom."

An investigation is currently underway, as French poet Guillaume Apollinaire, and his friend Pablo Picasso are under arrent and in questioning for Apollinaires remarks that the Louvre should be 'burnt down.' With little evidence against them, they may be exonerated. The painting was last seen yesterday evening, and was realized to be missing when gaurds were informed by French painter, Louis Béroud, that it was gone.

The Louvre was immediately contacted about returning the piece after one Uffizi employee recognized the painting as the Mona Lisa. They also took note to report the man who had sold them the painting less than a month ago, one Vincenzo Peruggia. Peruggia was identified as a Louvre employee and Italian Nationalist who believed Italy to be the rightful claimant to DeVinci's work. According to French athorities, he had stolen the painting after closing hours and had hidden it under his coat.

No one knows currently how many people died in the event, but luckily the RMS Carpathia was near enough to the scene to rescue an estimated 705 passengers. The so-called 'unsinkable ship' is calling into question society's industrialization and need to overcome nature. Even her sister ships, Olympic and Britannic are being scrutinized as too dangerous for public use. It is unknown what will become of the ships, but it is unlikely that Harland & Wolff will build anymore Olympic-class ocean liners."

The obstacle would have gone unnoticed if not for a telegram sent by the SS Californian warning of two separate icebergs. The telegram was intended to reach SS Antillian, but an operator on the RMS Titanic accidentally intercepted the message. Although the ship probably would have been fine, given that it had two hulls, Captain Smith noted that, while confident in the ship's design and construction, he thought the bump could shake the ship and frighten the passengers, so he decided to redirect their course."

He classified the fossil as 'Eoanthropus dawsoni,' or, 'Dawson's Dawn-Man.' After being examined by several anthropologists at the society, the discovery was confirmed as legitimate, although there are many who believe it to be a hoax.

In fact, many believe that the war may continue for years with no end in sight. With dying morale, an unofficial ceasefire was called in honor of our Savior's day of birth, Christmas. On that day, soldiers didn't fight and gifts, such as alchohol from the rum ration, were given to their fellow man. But while the fighting continued, as if uninterupted on the next day, with just as much mud, blood and death as any other, the day before will always be remebered as a day of peace."

The film was met with critical acclaim for its revolutionary use of cinematography and creative technique. Many, however, view the film as tresonous, as it romanticises the Confederacy during the American Civil War, and they directly attribute the recent rise in the popularity of the Ku Klux Klan to it. In the few short weeks that the film has been out, the KKK has seen a significant increase in popularity, and a shift in behavior from a more, generalized anti-Union sentiment, to a more purely anti-negro one. Although American Minorities are greatly disturbed by this movie, popular opinion is that of contentedness."

While this movement did not form over night, only recently has it been officially recognized by art critics around the world. The movement has its roots in French artist Marcel Duchamp's works he called 'readymades.' These pieces exemplified his Reactionary thoughts on war and industrialization as a whole. They are ugly sculptures, made of two useful objects combined in such a way to render them useless. They are meant to illustrate how ugly the world has become and how it has devolved into throwing innocent boys at eachother to die.

 bulgaria.5.d:0 "We have recently petitioned for France to let us join the Entente, the French head of state [FRA.GetLeader] has recently announced that Bulgaria has become part of the Entente, the world's reaction has been mixed, the Russian Empire welcomes us while Germany is in strong protest, the Ottoman Empire has yet to respond. Whatever the world may think we are now secure as Russia is close at hand by sea and Entente friendly nations such as Romania to the north aren't that far, Great Britain might even station troops here to defend against any invasion either from the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. We are now in a very good position to diplomatically expand our borders via requests to return once held land, and few nations could muster the courage to attack us now."
 bulgaria.5.a:0 "Most excellent"
 bulgaria.6.t:0 "France Declines our Request"
 bulgaria.6.d:0 "Our ambassador in Paris brings word that the French initially hesitated then outright declined our request. This is infuriating as there is little we can do, if France doesn't want to help them, well fine! They'll have to make do without us as a valuable ally, we are in a strategic position in the Balkans, perhaps we can find some smaller allies in the region, or maybe join the Central Powers to show France that they consider us a valuable ally! We might even be able to forge an Unholy Alliance with the Ottoman Turks, although unlikely this would secure our borders, give us a strong ally and even partner in technological treaties. What shall we choose?"
 bulgaria.6.a:0 "We should found our own faction"

 bulgaria.7.t:0 "Invitation to the Balkan League"
 bulgaria.7.d:0 "Negotiations have been underway for some time now, but the so called Balkan League hasn't become anything official yet, but a few hours ago the Bulgarian ambassador requested a meeting with [ROOT.GetLeader] to discuss this balkan dream potentially becoming a reality, for the Bulgarians have called upon their Slav brethren to stand with them in face of the Turkish menace! This alliance of balkan nations could even potentially win a war against the Ottoman Empire but lest we lose the consequences would be dire. The Bulgarian Tsar says this alliance has the potential to do what not even the crusadering catholics or the Austrian Empire could do: completely push the Ottoman Empire from Europe! This alliance also has secret terms splitting up the Ottoman Empire's European territories in case of a victory. France & [AUS.GetName] have already tried negotiating peaceful terms, it seems to no avail. We must now consider making ourselves ready for war!"
 bulgaria.7.a:0 "We stand with our Bulgarian brethren"
 bulgaria.7.b:0 "This is insane!"
 bulgaria.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Declines"
 bulgaria.8.d:0 "It seems [FROM.GetName] thinks that we have no chance against the Ottoman Empire, or that they can stand alone against them. We can see that they are 'O so wrong but they remain blind until the Turks come knocking at their door, we must even consider annexing [FROM.GetName] in order not to let their land fall into enemy hands. The situation is badly dire, they refuse to reconsider, now only time will tell what will become of them."
 bulgaria.8.a:0 "Fools!"
 bulgaria.9.t:0 "Invitation to [BUL.GetFactionName]"
 bulgaria.9.d:0 "The Bulgarians, having form an alliance of their own have decided to invite us, this might be disadvantageous as it is rather small comprising only of a few balkan states, but Bulgaria's military might alone might help us tip the scales.

 bulgaria.10.a:0 "We stand with Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.10.b:0 "We should seek allies elsewhere"
 bulgaria.11.t:0 "Bulgaria Requests Aid"
 bulgaria.11.d:0 "The Bulgarians want to create a pan-balkan league, they have requested our help in the negotiations as their bitter rivalry with Serbia might cause age old bitterness to impede the negotiations, but with our help the Balkan League could be formed to combat the Turks in the Balkans, we might even be able to send a few troops to help them out in case of war. This would be our way of impeding the Turks as we can't risk all out war as that might provoke conflict with another great power. But from the shadows we might be able to help manipulate global events."
 bulgaria.11.a:0 "Yes we should"
 bulgaria.11.b:0 "We can't risk our involvement getting found out!"
 bulgaria.12.t:0 "General Mobilization"
 bulgaria.12.d:0 "Our high command reports that the entire army has been mobilized, and is ready for combat. This is in response to the Turkish threat, we have already told our allies to make ready for war, Serbia has mobilized it's army already it is now time to strike at the Ottoman Empire while their forces are stretched thin. It will take the Turks some time to get the bulk of their army from the Middle East to Europe, their infrastructure is very poor as is so they will be forced to go by sea, our Greek allies can impede them there. So now we go to war to reclaim our long lost territory!"
 bulgaria.12.a:0 "To arms!"
 bulgaria.13.t:0 "Bulgarian Offer of Peace"
 bulgaria.13.d:0 "Those Bulgarian scum who think that they are superior to us present us with a deal. The Balkan League wants to split up our European territories between themselves, they think we would cede this territory to them willingly! This deal is an insult to anger us. Those puny Balkan Nations shall see the wrath of the Ottoman Empire! There is only one problem: the forces of the Balkan League outnumber us greatly in Europe and it will take a lot of time to get our remaining armies there."
 bulgaria.13.a:0 "Who do They Think They Are?"
 bulgaria.13.b:0 "We have no choice but to concede"
 bulgaria.14.t:0 "Ultimatum from Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.14.d:0 "The Balkan League was formed to reclaim the territories we took from the 'O so many years ago. Now they are ready to strike, they present us with an ultimatum. Either cede all our European territories except for Instanbul or they will declare war! This situation is dire indeed as most of our forces are positioned away from Europe and mobilizing them and getting them there will take months. If we refuse they will declare war and the Bulgarians are poised to strike at our fortress in Edirne and ultimately our capital! If we refuse we risk getting defeated but if we accept then they might bicker amongst themselves for controll of the ceded territory but they might even feel brave enough to deman Istanbul! How do we respond?"
 bulgaria.14.a:0 "We don't have much of a choice"
 bulgaria.14.b:0 "We'll never bow to such lowly nations!"
 bulgaria.15.t:0 "Bulgaria Demands More"
 bulgaria.15.d:0 "Many have warned us of this but we never thought that this day would come. Bulgaria demands we cede our glorious capital Istanbul! We gave too many concessions to the League and now they demand more! Soon the Greeks will want Anatolia to reestablish the Byzantine Empire! This insolence has gone on too long, if we accept we'll become the laughing stock of Europe! It is time to wage war against these puny Balkan nations for the glory of our empire!"
 bulgaria.15.a:0 "Yes to arms!"
 bulgaria.15.b:0 "No we can't risk war"
 bulgaria.16.t:0 "Bulgarian Negotiations About Macedonia"
 bulgaria.16.d:0 "The Bulgarians not having received Macedonia as we agree upon forming the Balkan League are now trying to negotiate for it. We could either cede them the territory or they would kick us from the League. There is only one problem witht their claims: Macedonia possesses an ethnicly Serbian population, no matter what the Bulgarians say. So shall we lend a free hand to the Bulgarians to do whatever injustice they wish or shall we retaliate?"
 bulgaria.16.a:0 "These injustices shan't be tolerated!"
 bulgaria.16.b:0 "We should cede these territories"
 bulgaria.17.t:0 "Macedonia or War!"
 bulgaria.17.d:0 "Those treacherous Bulgarians have presented us with an ultimatum: either we cede Macedonia or they declare war upon us and the League. This is outrageous we can't cede a territory just because our former allies want it! They will surely be viewed by the world as an agressor, which means that we might even get the support of the world powers. This also leaves the Bulgarians exposed to the Romanians who for some time have been eyeing the territory of Dobrudja and most of all the Ottomans who want their former territories taken from them by Bulgaria back. We shouldn't be too hasty in cedeing Macedonia as all the advantages are on our side."
 bulgaria.17.a:0 "Yes we shouldn't be too hasty"
 bulgaria.17.b:0 "We can't afford conflict with Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.18.t:0 "Bulgaria Wants to Join the Entente"
 bulgaria.18.d:0 "With the world now in turmoil and our extremely vicious war with Germany, Bulgaria has now proposed that we accept them into the Entente to help fight the Central Powers. This is an ambitious undertaking by the Bulgarians as they border the Ottoman Empire who would be delighted for a chance to reclaim her former territories, but if they could be reinforce by perhaps say the British then they could strike at Instanbul and provide relief for Serbia. How shall we respond?"
 bulgaria.18.a:0 "Yes of course they're welcome"
 bulgaria.18.b:0 "They'd just weigh us down"
 bulgaria.19.t:0 "Bulgaria Wants to Join the Central Powers"
 bulgaria.19.d:0 "With the world now in turmoil and our extremely vicious war with France, Bulgaria has now proposed that we accept them into the Central Powers to help fight the Entente. This would provide major relief to the Ottoman Empire, finally establishing a route from Berlin to Instanbul if we were able to overrun Serbia, in which Bulgaria would also be very useful as they border Serbia and they could launch a new offensive from the south into Serbia finally forcing them to capitulate. On top of that they could capture Greece or assist in a naval invasion of the Crimea. This pact would be all around advantageous."
 bulgaria.19.a:0 "Why ever would we refuse?"
 bulgaria.19.b:0 "This would just hinder us"
 bulgaria.20.t:0 "Bulgaria Wants us to Join the Entente"
 bulgaria.20.d:0 "Our close friend the nation of Bulgaria wants us to join them in their fight against the central powers. This might even allow us to recapture Constantinople from those vile Turkish fiends, and at any rate if the Entente wins the war we would get some very powerful allies, and it might even dissuade Italy from attacking us in the future."
 bulgaria.20.a:0 "Let us join them then"
 bulgaria.20.b:0 "We should send supplies to help them"
 bulgaria.20.c:0 "We won't get involved in their wars"
 bulgaria.21.t:0 "Help from Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.21.d:0 "While not taking sides in the war Bulgaria has secretly shared some of their technological advancements as they obviously don't want the Central Powers winning the war as that would allow the Ottoman Turks to take steps towards annihilating Bulgaria."
 bulgaria.21.a:0 "Thank you Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.21.b:0 "We don't need your puny tech"
 bulgaria.22.t:0 "Help from Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.22.d:0 "While not taking sides in the war Bulgaria has secretly shared some of their technological advancements with us. This is natural as the Entente winning the war could only have negative consequences for Bulgaria, and when we win the war with this new technology we will obviously offer them protection for their help in winning the war."
 bulgaria.22.a:0 "Good choice Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.22.b:0 "We don't need it"
 bulgaria.23.t:0 "Military Access Request from Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.23.d:0 "The Bulgarians fighting alongside the Entente have requested that we give them military access as that would open a new front for them on the border with Austria-Hungary. While there's nothing wrong with giving military access in times of peace, this might lead to conflict with the Central Powers, and it would also be our land suffering artillery bombardment."
 bulgaria.23.a:0 "Give them access anyways"
 bulgaria.23.b:0 "Refuse"
 bulgaria.24.t:0 "Alliance with Bulgaria"
 bulgaria.24.d:0 "The Bulgarians have been courting us for some time now, even going so far as to revoke their claim on our territory. Now they propose an unholy alliance, between our two nations. This would be greatly beneficial for them and we could use their many troops to help us in case of war. This might also prevent conflict with the [SOV.GetName] as they see Bulgaria as a bastion if slavness and wouldn't dare attack it. In the future we might even be able to reintegrate the Bulgarians into our mighty empire. Who knows? Only time will tell."
 bulgaria.24.a:0 "We accept"
 bulgaria.24.b:0 "There is no use allying such a puny nation"
 bulgaria.25.t:0 "Tsar Ferdinand Crowned"
 bulgaria.25.d:0 "In the year [GetDateText] our glorious Tsar Ferdinand finally reconquered Constantinople! He will now be crowned as Basileus Rhomaíōn: Emperor of the Romans for succeding where everyone else has failed in reclaiming Constantinople from the Turks and finally driving them from Europe! No other nation can claim to have done this! The Poles tried to drive the Ottomans from Europe in 1443, they failed. Then the Hungarians couldn't resist them and Vienna was almost captured in 1529. After that the Austrians succeeded in driving them from Hungary but the Balkans were the Turks' last stronghold in Europe. Now even constantinople has been reclaimed by our mighty army and we have a right to claim the title Basileus of the Roman Empire. Tsar Ferdinand was hastily transported to the city which he entered upon a majestic white stallion he is now to be crowned signifying a new age in Bulgarian history!"
 bulgaria.25.a:0 "Claim the crown!"
 bulgaria.26.t:0 "Request from Bulgaria for a Submarine"
 bulgaria.26.d:0 "The Bulgarians have helped us in the Serbian campaign now they request we transfer them one of our submarines to help guard the coast against the [SOV.GetName], it shouldn't hurt to send them one as they'll put it to good use."

 bulgaria.26.b:0 "We can't spare any"
 bulgaria.27.t:0 "Bulgaria Orders Cruisers"
 bulgaria.27.d:0 "The Bulgarian government having expanded their navy has now placed an order for a light and heavy cruiser. These could be a valuable asset to their navy and would improve our relations, but who knows where these ships would be needed within our navy?"
 bulgaria.27.a:0 "Sure, send them"
 bulgaria.27.b:0 "We can't spare any"
 bulgaria.28.t:0 "Bulgaria orders a Battleship"
 bulgaria.28.d:0 "Bulgaria has asked us to construct them a battleship worthy of their mighty navy. This would be the first Bulgarian battleship as they haven't yet had the resources to construct one. This would greatly improve relations but at what cost?"
 bulgaria.28.a:0 "Send it to them"
 bulgaria.28.b:0 "We can't spare it"
 bulgaria.29.t:0 "Mobilization of the Army"
 bulgaria.29.d:0 "As the Turks have refused our peaceful deal, we have had to mobilize the army to counter any Turkish forces stationed on our borders. The army is now ready to defend the motherland and our allies have done the same. The Turks wil now know what a mistake it was to deny our request."
 bulgaria.29.a:0 "Yes they regret it"
 bulgaria.30.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Refuses the Ultimatum"
 bulgaria.30.d:0 "As expected the Ottoman Empire refused our ultimatum splitting up their European territories amongst the League, we now have to honour our terms and declare war upon the Turks, we have the word of our allies that they will come to aid us. So now we march off to war!"
 bulgaria.30.a:0 "As expected"
 bulgaria.31.t:0 "The Ottomans Cede Constantinople"
 bulgaria.31.d:0 "Surprisingly the Ottoman Empire has decided to cede Constantinople instead of risking war with our mighty empire, we now have the City of the World's Desire within our grasp! We should hurry to develop it and fulfill the wishes of our Tsar to crown him there."
 bulgaria.31.a:0 "Great"
 bulgaria.32.t:0 "The Ottomans Refuse"
 bulgaria.32.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire has refused our demands to cede Constantinople, this is not surprising as after cedeing all their European territory they would hardly give up their capital and mightiest city without a fight. Ottoman Sultan [TUR.GetLeader] has stated that we would only get into Constantinople over his dead body."
 bulgaria.32.a:0 "So be it"
 bulgaria.32.b:0 "Back down"
 bulgaria.33.t:0 "Serbia Cedes Macedonia"
 bulgaria.33.d:0 "After lengthy negotiations the Serbians have decided to cede Macedonia peacefully without a fight. The Serbian government has retracted it's statements that the population of Macedonia is ethnicly Serbian, as everyone knows that is a lie. Macedonia now belongs to us with the Balkan League intact. This is a great victory for diplomacy."
 bulgaria.33.a:0 "Yes it is"
 bulgaria.34.t:0 "Serbia Cedes Macedonia"
 bulgaria.34.d:0 "After we issued an ultimatum to Serbia to cede Macedonia or risk war the Serbs have decided to cede the territory although they now resent us most bitterly. They continue to overlook the fact that without our help they would never have won the Balkan War and that they agreed beforehand to give Macedonia to us. They say this is but another act of Bulgarian aggression. Such lies do the Serbs spread about us! No matter we now have all the territories of Greater Bulgaria and now the world shall see the might of the Bulgarian Empire!"
 bulgaria.34.a:0 "Yes, they shall see"
 bulgaria.35.t:0 "Serbians Reject the Ultimatum"
 bulgaria.35.d:0 "Those deluded Serbs think they can withstand the might of our empire! They have rejected the ultimatum cedeing Macedonia to us as was agreed at the forming of the Balkan League. Now they shall witness our wrath, we outnumber their troops and we will quickly overwhelm them before the great powers even have time to respond! The only problem is the Ottoman Empire which might see this war as an opportunity to regain the lost territories which we took from the at the end of the Balkan War, they might see fit to backstab us and attack while we're dealing with Serbia."
 bulgaria.35.a:0 "No matter, Serbia shall pay"
 bulgaria.35.b:0 "We can't risk war with these conditions"
 bulgaria.36.t:0 "Workers Protest"
 bulgaria.36.d:0 "With our recent extreme policies building factories many workers have become discontent with the long working hours and the hard work. There have been a wave of strikes across the country and our factory output has massively decreased. If we countinue these extreme policies there will probably be more of these protests. But as long as it doesn't lead to open rebellion we'll probably be fine."

 bulgaria.38.d:0 "We have finally finished our extreme factory building and now the nation is racked with another wave of protests. No matter these will end soon as the extreme factory constructions we have commissioned have now been finished and this has lifted a great weight from the shoulders of the workers as well as having reduced unemployment by more than 5%! We will just have to wait these strikes out, let the workers have their victory and continue on normally."

However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action.

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."

 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either.

The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.11.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."

 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.12.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"

 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it.

Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public.

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
